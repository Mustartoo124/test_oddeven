# Testing Guide: Distributed Systems in Odd/Even Tic-Tac-Toe

This guide helps you understand and test the distributed systems concepts implemented in this game.

## üéØ Core Concepts to Verify

### 1. Server Authority (Single Source of Truth)

**What to test:** The server maintains the correct board state, not the clients.

**Test procedure:**
1. Open two browser windows side-by-side (let's call them Window A and Window B)
2. Wait for both to connect and receive player assignments
3. In Window A, click square 0
4. Verify Window B also shows the updated value
5. Both windows should always show the same numbers in the same squares

**What you're verifying:**
- Clients cannot unilaterally change the board
- Server broadcasts changes to all clients
- Both clients stay synchronized

**Why it matters:** If clients could change values locally without server approval, two players could end up with different board states, breaking the game.

### 2. Operational Transforms (Increments vs. States)

**What to test:** Both clicks count even when simultaneous.

**Test procedure:**
1. Open two windows, wait for game start
2. Both players rapidly click the same square (e.g., square 12)
3. Count the clicks you make in each window
4. Watch the square's value increment
5. Verify the final value = initial value + total number of clicks from both players

**Example:**
```
Initial: square[12] = 0
Window A clicks 3 times quickly
Window B clicks 2 times quickly
Expected final value: 5 (0 + 3 + 2)
```

**Why this works:**
- Each click sends: `{type: INCREMENT, square: 12}`
- Server receives both operations and applies them sequentially
- Operations accumulate: 0 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 5

**What would fail with state sync:**
```
If we sent {type: SET_VALUE, square: 12, value: 5}:
- Window A sends: SET square 12 = 5
- Window B sends: SET square 12 = 5
- Server gets both, last one wins
- Result: Only ONE click counted, second overwrites first
```

### 3. Race Conditions and Message Ordering

**What to test:** The server's processing order determines truth, not click timing.

**Test procedure:**
1. Click square 5 in Window A (this is your "first click in real time")
2. Immediately (same millisecond) click square 5 in Window B
3. Check the server logs (if enabled) to see which message arrived first
4. The value should increment twice regardless of which "felt first"

**Key insight:**
- Network latency means "first click" in real time ‚â† "first message to arrive at server"
- Server doesn't care about real-time order, only arrival order at the server
- This is why fairness at scale is hard (but fair enough in practice)

---

### 4. Simultaneous Clicks on Different Squares

**What to test:** Concurrent operations on different squares don't interfere.

**Test procedure:**
1. Window A clicks square 0
2. Window B clicks square 24 at the same time
3. Verify both squares increment independently
4. Both increments should succeed (not cancel each other)

**Why it works:** Operations on different squares are truly independent.

---

### 5. Win Detection Consistency

**What to test:** Both players see the same winner.

**Test procedure:**
1. Play until someone wins (try to build a line of odd or even numbers)
2. When a win is detected, verify:
   - Both windows show the same "GAME OVER" message
   - Both highlight the same winning line
   - Both show the same winner (ODD or EVEN)

**What you're verifying:**
- Win detection is deterministic (same board ‚Üí same result)
- All clients receive the same game-over message
- The winning line is correctly identified

---

### 6. Disconnection Handling

**What to test:** Game ends gracefully when a player disconnects.

**Test procedure:**
1. Start a game with two players
2. Close one browser tab/window
3. In the remaining window, verify:
   - Connection status changes to "Disconnected" or "Opponent disconnected"
   - Game becomes unplayable
   - A message appears explaining the disconnection

**Why it matters:** Preventing "hung" games waiting for disconnected players.

## üîç Advanced Testing

### Observing Message Flow

**Using Browser DevTools:**

1. Open Window A in Chrome
2. Press F12 to open DevTools
3. Go to the "Network" tab, then switch to "WS" (WebSocket) filter
4. You'll see WebSocket frames as messages are sent/received
5. Click in the game and watch the messages flow

**Message examples you'll see:**
- `{"type":"INCREMENT","square":12}` (client sends)
- `{"type":"UPDATE","square":12,"value":6,"board":[...]}` (server responds)

### Testing with Server Logs

**Modify `server.js` to add logging:**

```javascript
ws.on('message', (data) => {
  try {
    const message = JSON.parse(data);
    console.log('Server received:', message);
    // ... rest of message handling
  }
  // ...
});
```

Then run:
```bash
npm run server 2>&1 | tee server.log
```

Watch the logs while playing to see each operation being processed.

## üéì Thought Experiments

### Thought Experiment 1: What if we used states instead?

**Scenario:** Both players click square 5 simultaneously. Square 5 has value 4.

**With states (WRONG):**
```
Window A: value 5, sends {type: SET, square: 5, value: 5}
Window B: value 5, sends {type: SET, square: 5, value: 5}
Server receives both, applies last one: square 5 = 5
Result: Only 1 click counted (lost 1 click)
```

**With operations (RIGHT):**
```
Window A: sends {type: INCREMENT, square: 5}
Window B: sends {type: INCREMENT, square: 5}
Server receives both:
  - First: 4 ‚Üí 5
  - Second: 5 ‚Üí 6
Result: Both clicks counted (value: 6)
```

### Thought Experiment 2: What if the server was wrong about the order?

**Scenario:** Due to network quirks, messages arrive in unexpected order.

**Example:**
```
Real-time order:   Player A clicks at 12:00:00.001
                   Player B clicks at 12:00:00.002

Network order:     Player B's message arrives at server first
                   Player A's message arrives second

Server processes:
  - Player B's INCREMENT: 4 ‚Üí 5
  - Player A's INCREMENT: 5 ‚Üí 6
  
Result: square 5 = 6 (same as real-time order!)
```

**Key insight:** Operational transforms make message order irrelevant. Whether A's message arrives before B's or vice versa, both clicks count and the final state is deterministic.

## üöÄ Performance Testing

### Testing Rapid Clicks

**Procedure:**
1. In one window, repeatedly click the same square as fast as possible
2. Watch the number increment smoothly
3. Open DevTools Network tab to verify each click is sent

**Expected behavior:**
- Number increments for each click
- No clicks are lost
- No errors in console

### Testing Many Players (Simulation)

**Procedure:**
1. Open 3 or more browser windows connected to the game
2. The 3rd+ should show an error message
3. Try to verify that only Odd and Even players can play

**Server should:** Reject the 3rd player connection with error message.

## üéÆ Playing to Learn

The best way to understand distributed systems is to play and reason about:

1. **Why can't I change my own board without the server?**
   - Answer: Because multiple clients would conflict

2. **Why do rapid clicks count even if simultaneous?**
   - Answer: Because we send operations, not states

3. **Why does the server need to broadcast changes back to me?**
   - Answer: So we stay synchronized with other players and know the truth

4. **What if my click was "lost"?**
   - Answer: Sending operations makes loss less likely; states make it certain

5. **How is this like Google Docs?**
   - Answer: Same architecture‚Äîcentral server, operational transforms, eventual consistency

## üêõ Debugging Tips

### If values don't increment:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify WebSocket connection shows "Connected" or "Waiting for opponent..."
- Check that server is running: `npm run server`

### If both players see different values:
- This shouldn't happen‚Äîif it does, the synchronization logic is broken
- Check server logs for increment processing

### If "Waiting for opponent..." never resolves:
- Check that two separate browser windows/tabs are actually running
- Verify server is listening on port 8081

### If you can play after game over:
- The client-side disable logic might be broken
- Check that `winner` state is being set correctly

## üìö Further Learning

After understanding this game, research:

1. **Lamport Clocks** - Logical ordering without physical time
2. **Vector Clocks** - Detecting causality across processes
3. **Eventual Consistency** - How distributed systems achieve consistency
4. **CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types)** - Alternative to operational transforms
5. **Raft Consensus** - How distributed systems agree on truth

All of these concepts are demonstrated in miniature by this simple game.

**Good luck testing! Understanding these concepts deeply will make you a better systems thinker. üöÄ**
